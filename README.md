## Description
I have made a quiz using Javascirpt, HTML and CSS. The quiz is regarding testing user's knowledge on Javascript. The quiz starts with a timer of 100 seconds and there are in total 5 questions. If user selects wrong answer for any question then the timer wil deduct 20s from the total time. In the end, whatever time will be left is going to be user's high score.
